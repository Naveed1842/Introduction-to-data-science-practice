##APIs
**What is an API?**
* Application Programming Interface
* Structured way to expose specific functionality and data access to users
* Web APIs usually follow the "REST" standard
**How to interact with a REST API:**
* Make a "request" to a specific URL (an "endpoint"), and get the data back in a "response"
* Most relevant request method for us is GET (other methods: POST, PUT, DELETE)
* Response is often JSON format
* Web console is sometimes available (allows you to explore an API)
